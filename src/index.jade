            The most efficient way to gain experience points in Pokemon Go is to save all your evolutions and do them while you use a Lucky Egg. Unfortunately, a lucky egg only lasts for 30 minutes. Use this calculator to make the most of your time!
          ol
            li: p.
              Acquire a lucky egg. You will get one when you reach level 8, 9, 10, 15. You will get two on level 20. #[a(href='http://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-go/Level_Rewards_and_Unlockable_Items') (reference)]
            li: p.
              Don't evolve any Pokemon. Save up all your evolvables!
            li: p.
              Once you get enough evolutions (around 150 Pidgey candies), use this calculator to get step-by-step instructions on how to make the most of your Lucky Egg.
